To troubleshoot unexpected behavior, Netests.io will automatically create a logs file.

It is created where Netests.io is run.

```shell
more ./netests.logs
```

For each Netests.io, a banner is printed into the log file.

```shell
******************************************************
*                                                    *
*                New Netests.io RUN                  *
*                                                    *
******************************************************
```

Here is an example of the beginning of the log file
